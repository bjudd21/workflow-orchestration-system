# Workflow Orchestration System

A phase-based, multi-agent workflow that transforms a project idea into a council-reviewed PRD, structured task list, and GitHub Issues — using local Ollama inference with no API keys required.

**Status**: True MVP in progress — Phase 2 (PRD Interview) complete and tested.

---

## How It Works

```
Phase 2: PRD Interview      → Conversational requirements gathering (webhook chat UI)
Phase 3: PRD Synthesis      → Quality model synthesizes a full PRD from the interview
Phase 4: Council Review     → 4 specialist agents review; chair synthesizes findings
Phase 5: Task Generation    → PRD → structured task list + GitHub Issues
Phase 6: Execution Tracking → Claude Code picks up tasks; PR review automation
```

Phases hand off via validated markdown artifacts stored in `workspace/{project}/handoffs/`.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# First-time setup: checks prerequisites, pulls models, starts n8n
./setup.sh

# Subsequent runs
docker compose up -d

# Access n8n at http://localhost:5678
```

### Prerequisites

- WSL2 (Ubuntu) or Linux
- NVIDIA GPU with ≥18GB VRAM (RTX 4090, RTX 4080, or equivalent)
- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine + Compose
- Ollama with CUDA support (`ollama serve` running on host)
- ~40GB free disk space for model weights

---

## Phase 2: PRD Interview

Phase 2 is the first working phase. Open the chat UI in a browser:

```
http://localhost:5678/webhook/prd-interview
```

Enter a project name, then start typing. The interviewer asks one question at a time across 8 coverage areas (problem, users, features, scope, NFRs, compliance, tech constraints, timeline). When all areas are covered, it signals completion, extracts structured requirements, and writes the handoff file.

**Handoff output**: `workspace/{project-name}/handoffs/002-prd-interview.md`

To restart or reset an interview, delete `workspace/{project-name}/interview-state.json`.

---

## Model Configuration

Two models are used and **can coexist** on a 24GB GPU (both are ~18GB):

| Role | Model | VRAM | Used for |
|------|-------|------|----------|
| Speed | `qwen3.5:35b-a3b` | ~18GB | Interview turns, council reviewers |
| Quality | `qwen3:30b-a3b` | ~18GB | PRD synthesis, council chair |

Pull both before running:
```bash
ollama pull qwen3.5:35b-a3b
ollama pull qwen3:30b-a3b
```

The setup script handles this automatically.

## Architecture Notes

- **Ollama runs on the host**, not in Docker. Accessed from n8n container via `host.docker.internal:11434`.
- **File I/O** in Code nodes uses `require('fs')` — works in self-hosted n8n despite validator warnings.
- **Model swap latency**: 15–30s between speed and quality model. Workflows batch all speed-model calls before invoking the quality model once.
- **State persistence**: Conversation state is stored as JSON in `workspace/{project}/interview-state.json`. Restarting n8n or Docker does not lose state.
- **Handoff validation**: Each phase validates its output against schemas in `contracts/` before writing the handoff file.
